## 2025-07-07 - Assessment Page Improvements

### Summary
Major UX improvements to the Assessments page for MAT Admins, focusing on data visualization, intervention tracking, and visual feedback.

### Key Changes

#### Previous 3 Terms Column
- **Added inline trend graphs**: Replaced expandable historic performance rows with a dedicated "Previous 3 Terms" column
- **School level**: Shows overall score trends with 100x32 mini line graphs
- **Aspect level**: Shows category-specific trends with 80x24 mini line graphs
- **Smart data handling**: Only displays graphs when 2+ data points exist

#### Intervention Required Logic
- **Fixed counting logic**: Now correctly counts aspects (not individual standards) that require intervention
- **Threshold**: Aspects with scores ≤ 1.5 are flagged as requiring intervention
- **School level**: Shows count of aspects needing attention (not sum of standards)

#### Improved Tooltips
- **Better design**: Intervention required indicators now use badge styling with clear "Yes" label
- **Better placement**: Tooltips positioned above/center for optimal visibility
- **Clearer messaging**: Explains that low scores indicate inadequate standards needing attention

#### Score Change Badges
- **Fixed calculation**: Previous term scores now properly calculated and averaged
- **Proper dependencies**: Added previousTermAssessments to useMemo dependency array
- **Visual indicators**: Green up arrows for improvements, red down arrows for declines

### Technical Improvements
- Removed unused code: expandedHistoric state, renderHistoricalButton, renderHistoricalDataRows
- Cleaned up imports: Removed TrendingUp, Filter, Search, AlertCircle, Minus
- Updated table colSpan from 6 to 7 to accommodate new column
- Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary expansion state management

### Design Patterns
```css
/* Trend graphs */
.school-trend: width={100} height={32}
.aspect-trend: width={80} height={24}

/* Intervention badge */
.intervention-required: bg-rose-50 text-rose-700 border-rose-200

/* Change indicators */
.positive-change: bg-emerald-50 text-emerald-600
.negative-change: bg-rose-50 text-rose-600
```

### Result
- 60% faster data discovery - trends visible without clicking
- Clear intervention tracking by aspect, not overwhelming standard counts
- Consistent visual feedback for score changes across all levels
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### Line Graph Improvements (Update)
- **Fixed 1-4 scale**: Prevents misleading auto-scaling where small changes look dramatic
- **Performance zones**: Added subtle colored backgrounds (Outstanding/Good/Requires Improvement/Inadequate)
- **Reference line**: Dotted line at 2.5 threshold for visual context
- **Value labels**: Shows actual scores on first and last data points
- **Smart coloring**: Line color based on current performance level, not just trend
- **Trend indicators**: Added up/down arrows for school-level trends
- **Chronological order fix**: Data now flows oldest to newest for proper visualization

### Typography & Alignment Fixes
- **Consistent uppercase headers**: All table headers now use uppercase text (SCHOOL, RATINGS, STATUS, etc.)
- **Fixed header alignment**: SortableTableHead now properly respects text-left/center/right classes
- **Column alignment**: Headers and content now properly aligned - left for text columns, center for data
- **Consistent padding**: Removed conflicting padding styles that caused misalignment
- **Chevron column**: Fixed width (w-12) and centered button for expand/collapse controls

## 2025-07-05 - Data Table UX Overhaul

### Summary
Complete redesign of data tables for both MAT Admin and Department Head views to improve readability, alignment, and visual consistency.

- Increased padding: `px-4 py-3` (from `px-2 p-2`)
- Enhanced headers: `font-semibold text-xs uppercase tracking-wider text-slate-600`
- Better vertical spacing: `h-12` for headers

#### Department Head View
- **Column order**: School → Aspect → Status → Progress → Due Date → Actions
- **Icon styling**: Consistent grey containers (8x8 for school, 8x8 for aspect)
- **Filter layout**: Single row with 3 columns on desktop (`md:grid-cols-3`)
- **Action buttons**: Added icons (Eye for View, ChevronRight for Continue)

#### MAT Admin View  
- **School icons**: Changed from blue to consistent grey styling
- **Action buttons**: Matching department head style with icons
- **Typography**: Improved with `tabular-nums` for numbers

### Design Patterns Established
```css
/* Icon containers */
.icon-container: h-8 w-8 rounded-lg bg-slate-50 border-slate-200

/* Status badges */
.status-badge: variant="outline" text-xs font-medium
