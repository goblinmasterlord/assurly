  - Form resets properly after attempted creation

## 🔄 **Backend Endpoints Status**

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `GET /api/assessments` | ✅ Working | Full integration complete |
| `GET /api/assessments/{id}` | ✅ Working | Full integration complete |
| `POST /submit` | ❌ Not Found | Previously worked, may be removed |
| `POST /api/submit` | ❌ Not Found | Alternative endpoint not found |
| `POST /api/assessments` | ❌ Not Found | Creation endpoint not implemented |
| `GET /api/schools` | ❌ Not Found | Using fallback from assessments |
| `GET /api/standards` | ❌ Not Found | Using fallback data |

## 📊 **Current Data Flow**

```
Frontend Request → API Client → Backend API → Data Transformers → Frontend Components
```

### **Working Data Flow:**
1. **Assessment List**: Assessments page loads real data from `/api/assessments`
2. **Assessment Details**: Detail page loads real standards from `/api/assessments/{id}`
3. **School Data**: Dynamically extracted from assessment data
4. **Data Display**: All transformations working, proper formatting
5. **Change Tracking**: Cross-term comparisons working with real data
6. **Performance Metrics**: Real-time calculation and display

### **Simulated Data Flow:**
1. **Assessment Saving**: Frontend shows success but data not actually saved
2. **Assessment Creation**: Frontend shows "not available" message

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Backend Team**

1. **Restore/Implement Submit Endpoint** 
   - Implement `POST /submit` or `POST /api/submit`
   - Accept the current payload format (entries array)
   - Return `{"status": "success"}` on success

2. **Assessment Creation Endpoint**
   - Implement `POST /api/assessments` 
   - Accept category, school_ids, term_id, academic_year, due_date
   - Return created assessment IDs

3. **Optional Optimizations**
   - `GET /api/schools` - Dedicated schools endpoint
   - `GET /api/standards` - Standards by category endpoint

## 🛠 **Frontend Configuration**

- **Backend URL**: `https://assurly-backend-400616570417.europe-west2.run.app`
- **Environment**: `.env.local` configured
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks implemented
- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging for unavailable features

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

- ✅ Assessment list loads successfully (28 assessments found)
- ✅ Assessment details load with standards (5 standards per assessment)
- ✅ Data transformations working correctly
- ✅ School extraction working (4 schools found)
- ✅ Error handling working for missing endpoints
- ✅ User experience maintained even with missing backend features
