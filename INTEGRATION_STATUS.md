# Backend Integration Status

## ✅ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE - FULLY OPERATIONAL**

The Assurly assessment platform has been successfully integrated with the live backend API. All core functionality is working with real data.

**Backend URL:** `https://assurly-frontend-400616570417.europe-west2.run.app`

---

## 🎯 **COMPLETED INTEGRATIONS**

### **Core Assessment Operations** ✅
- **GET /api/assessments** - Assessment list retrieval
- **GET /api/assessments/{id}** - Assessment detail retrieval  
- **POST /api/assessments** - Assessment creation
- **POST /api/assessments/{id}/submit** - Assessment submission/updates

### **Supporting Data Operations** ✅  
- **GET /api/schools** - School data retrieval
- **GET /api/standards** - Standards data retrieval (with aspect filtering)

### **Data Transformation Layer** ✅
- **Complete bidirectional mapping** between backend and frontend data formats
- **Status mapping:** `not_started` ↔ `Not Started`, `in_progress` ↔ `In Progress`, `completed` ↔ `Completed`
- **Term mapping:** `T1` ↔ `Autumn`, `T2` ↔ `Spring`, `T3` ↔ `Summer`
- **Academic year conversion:** `2024-25` ↔ `2024-2025`
- **Category mapping:** Complete mapping between backend and frontend category names

## 🚀 **RECENT FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Save Functionality Enhancement** ✅ *JUST FIXED*
**Issue:** Save functionality was not persisting evidence-only changes when standards hadn't been rated yet.

**Root Cause:** Frontend was only saving standards that had ratings (`rating !== null`), ignoring standards with evidence but no rating.

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Updated save logic to include standards with either ratings OR evidence
- ✅ Backend accepts `rating: null` for unrated standards with evidence
- ✅ Improved user feedback with detailed save confirmation messages
- ✅ Enhanced submit validation to ensure all standards are rated before submission

**Technical Details:**
- Modified `handleSave()` to collect all standards with either ratings or evidence
- API now receives standards with `rating: null` for evidence-only updates
- Maintains UPSERT behavior for progressive saving

## 📊 **CATEGORY MAPPING (Backend ↔ Frontend)**

| Backend Category | Frontend Category | Status |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `education` | `Education` | ✅ Active |
| `hr` | `Human Resources` | ✅ Active |
| `finance` | `Finance & Procurement` | ✅ Active |
| `estates` | `Estates` | ✅ Active |
| `governance` | `Governance` | ✅ Active |
| `it` | `IT & Information Services` | ✅ Active |
| `is` | `IT & Information Services` | ✅ Active (alias) |
| N/A | `IT (Digital Strategy)` | ⚠️ Maps to `it` for now |

**Note:** Backend provides 6 distinct categories with standards. Frontend has 7 categories where "IT (Digital Strategy)" currently maps to the same backend category as "IT & Information Services".
