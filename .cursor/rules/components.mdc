# Frontend Component Reference

This document provides a functional description of the frontend components in the Assurly application.

## Core Application Components

### `src/App.tsx`
- **Description:** The main application component that sets up client-side routing using `react-router-dom`. It defines the overall page structure, including a `RootLayout` and routes for different pages like `HomePage`, `AssessmentsPage`, and `AssessmentDetailPage`. It also incorporates the `Toaster` component for displaying notifications.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Uses `BrowserRouter` for routing.
    - Defines `Routes` and individual `Route` components.
    - Integrates `RootLayout` for consistent page structure.
    - Includes `Toaster` for global notifications.

## Layouts

### `src/layouts/RootLayout.tsx`

### `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx`
- **Description:** A component that renders the actual toast notifications based on the state managed by the `useToast` hook. It iterates through active toasts and displays them using the `Toast` component and its parts.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Uses `useToast` hook (presumably from `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`) to get the list of current toasts.
    - Renders each toast within a `ToastProvider` and `ToastViewport`.
    - Dynamically displays `ToastTitle`, `ToastDescription`, and any associated `action` for each toast.

### `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`
- **Description:** Components for creating tooltips – small informational popups that appear when a user hovers over or focuses on an element. Based on Radix UI's Tooltip primitive.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Exports:
        - `TooltipProvider`: Should wrap a major part of the application (or the whole app) to enable tooltips.
        - `Tooltip`: The root component that groups a trigger and its content.
        - `TooltipTrigger`: The element that, when interacted with (hover/focus), shows the tooltip.
        - `TooltipContent`: The actual content of the tooltip message.
    - Behavior: Manages the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip content based on interaction with the trigger.
    - Props: `TooltipContent` has `sideOffset` to control distance from the trigger.

### `src/components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- **Description:** A reusable multi-select dropdown component with search and badge display. Built on top of Radix Popover and the Command (cmdk) list for powerful filtering and keyboard navigation.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Props: `options` (array of `{ label, value, icon? }`), `selected` (string[]), `onChange` (callback), various text placeholders.
    - Features: Type-ahead search, keyboard navigation, clear-all option (at bottom with separator), optional icons, fully accessible keyboard support.
    - **UX Design**: Fixed height trigger (h-9) that shows "X selected" for multiple items or the single item name. No badge stacking to prevent layout jumping.
    - **Clear All**: Positioned at bottom of dropdown with separator, only shows when items are selected, includes count "Clear all (X)".
    - **Trigger Display**: Shows placeholder when empty, single item name when one selected, "X selected" format for multiple items.

### `src/components/ui/term-stepper.tsx`
- **Description:** Academic term navigation component with previous/next buttons and dropdown selector for terms.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Props: `terms` (string[]), `currentTerm` (string), `onTermChange` (callback), `showDropdown` (boolean), `className`.
    - Features: Chronological term ordering (Autumn > Summer > Spring within academic years), navigation buttons, dropdown fallback.
    - **UX Design**: Fixed width (220px) to prevent layout jumping, truncation for long terms, consistent styling between button and dropdown modes.
    - Layout: Shows "X of Y" counter, supports both interactive (with dropdown) and display-only modes.

### `src/components/ui/filter-bar.tsx`
- **Description:** Professional, reusable filter container component with intelligent layout system for different view contexts.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Props: `title`, `filters` (FilterConfig[]), `onClearAll`, `layout` ('mat-admin' | 'department-head'), `className`.
    - **Filter Types**: 'search' (with icon), 'multiselect' (using MultiSelect component), 'checkbox' (with label).
    - **Intelligent Layouts**: 
      - MAT Admin: 12-column grid (Search: 4 cols, MultiSelects: 2 cols each, Checkbox: 2 cols)
      - Department Head: 8-10 column grid (Search: 4 cols, MultiSelects: 2 cols each)
    - **Professional Design**: Consistent h-9 height, gap-4 spacing, responsive breakpoints, conditional Clear All button.
    - **Smart Features**: Clear All only shows when filters have values, automatic column span calculation, responsive grid collapse.

## Utility Functions (`src/lib/`)

### `src/lib/assessment-utils.tsx`
- **Description:** Utility functions for assessment data processing and display.
- **Key Functions:**
    - `getStrategyDisplayName(category)`: Maps strategy codes to full display names (Hr → Human Resources, It → IT & Information Services, etc.).
    - `getStrategyShortCode(category)`: Converts full names back to short codes for consistency.
    - Handles various input formats and provides fallback display names.

### `src/lib/category-utils.tsx`
- **Description:** Category-specific utility functions and constants.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Category mapping and validation functions.
    - Integration with assessment-utils for strategy name handling.
    - Category-specific styling and icon mappings.

### Key Design Principles Applied:
1. **Consistent Heights**: All interactive elements use h-9 (36px) for perfect alignment
2. **Professional Spacing**: gap-4 (16px) standard, with contextual adjustments
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with intelligent breakpoints
4. **Conditional UI**: Clear buttons, filters, and features only show when relevant
5. **Fixed Layouts**: Prevents layout jumping with fixed widths and consistent sizing
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
7. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
