# Frontend Component Reference

This document provides a functional description of the frontend components in the Assurly application.

## Core Application Components

### `src/App.tsx`
- **Description:** The main application component that sets up client-side routing using `react-router-dom`. It defines the overall page structure, including a `RootLayout` and routes for different pages like `HomePage`, `AssessmentsPage`, and `AssessmentDetailPage`. It also incorporates the `Toaster` component for displaying notifications.
- **Key Properties/Functionality:**
    - Uses `BrowserRouter` for routing.
    - Defines `Routes` and individual `Route` components.
    - Integrates `RootLayout` for consistent page structure.

## Layouts

### `src/layouts/RootLayout.tsx`
